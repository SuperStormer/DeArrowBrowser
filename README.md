# DeArrow Browser
An explorer for the [DeArrow](https://dearrow.ajay.app/) database as a web application.
Inspired by [Lartza's SBbrowser](https://github.com/Lartza/SBbrowser).

Public instance available at [dearrow.minibomba.pro](https://dearrow.minibomba.pro/).

This is repository is split into 4 crates:
- dearrow-parser - definitions of structures in source .csv files, reading & merging those into a single structure per detail
- dearrow-browser-server - the backend, keeps the database loaded in memory, provides data for the backend
- dearrow-browser-api - definitions of API structures
- dearrow-browser-frontend - the frontend, uses Yew, functions as a single page application

The logo is a combination of the DeArrow logo and the magnifying glass emoji from [twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji)
